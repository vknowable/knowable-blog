# In the Know: Namada

Privacy loves company, so Namada will reward you with NAM tokens for shielding any Ethereum/Cosmos tokens. Namada’s public testnet is running and we’re preparing for a Q1 launch. *[Stay In the Know](https://forms.gle/HRAQBSo85HGzKVSg9)* and we’ll alert you about opportunities and what’s coming next. 

Scammers, hackers, competitors, burglars–your assets are public knowledge, but Namada’s about to make it easy (and rewarding) to shield any of your Ethereum and Cosmos assets. The more you use Namada, the stronger the privacy guarantees for everyone. Namada is an important step toward data security in Web3. Read on or skip ahead!

## What’s Namada?

**Web3 asset privacy.** Why? Web3 promises secure digital ownership and control, but not over your information. Everything we do in Web3 is exposed to everyone–imagine if everyone in the world could see your entire history of credit card purchases and bank statements. Even if your address isn’t publicly known, it’s only a matter of time before all of your assets and transactions are exposed. Even something as simple as sending someone tokens reveals to them your entire transaction history.

How could Web3 be adopted by an organization–a business, advocacy group, government–anyone with anything to lose to an adversary–if all of our transactions, all of our assets, and our patterns of transactional behaviours are known by all?

**Namada will be a PoS blockchain that offers interchain asset privacy,** and Namada’s user-friendly interfaces will make privacy-preserving transfers more accessible. Simple, understandable privacy for any asset. Fast and cheap, with strong security guarantees.

At launch (Q1 2023), Namada will enable you to **shield any Ethereum or Cosmos assets,** including NFTs like ENS names. You’ll earn NAM (Namada’s native token) for any assets held with Namada, because more shielded assets strengthen the privacy guarantees for all participants. *[Stay In the Know](https://forms.gle/HRAQBSo85HGzKVSg9)* for updates and learn how to earn from shielding assets.

It’ll be easy and permissionless to transfer Ethereum and Cosmos assets to Namada, which will use a single, common shielded pool for all assets (fungible and non-fungible). “Transferring a CryptoKitty is indistinguishable from transferring ETH, DAI, ATOM, OSMO, NAM or any other asset on Namada,” cofounder Awa Sun Yin wrote in the [Oct 2022 article ‘What is Namada?’](https://blog.namada.net/what-is-namada/) (a great first step toward a technical deep dive).

### Anoma
You may have heard of Anoma, so let’s clarify. While Namada will initially look a lot like a Cosmos chain at launch, it will evolve as the first “fractal instance” of Anoma. The Anoma chain (Q4 2023) will offer an interchain coordination layer with full-stack privacy. Users express what they want instead of how to get it (and the system operators are responsible for figuring out how to get it). Anoma removes the need for centralized counterparty discovery points, like AMMs (Uniswap) and orderbooks.

## Heliax is launching Namada

Heliax (branded a public goods lab) is known for their former protocol development and validator staking service, Cryptium Labs. For three years, they shipped all major Tezos protocol upgrades in collaboration with Nomadic Labs. The founders are perhaps best known for their work on Cosmos.

Heliax cofounder Christopher Goes (blog) led the design and development of IBC, the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol. IBC is a key innovation for secure cross-chain communication that currently connects many high-value blockchains together. Being the gold cross-chain standard that binds the Cosmos ecosystem, IBC is also being adopted by ecosystems well beyond Cosmos.

Cofounder Awa Sun Yin is a former Chainalysis data scientist, a firm dedicated to deanonymizing and tracking Web3 users: “I used to work for surveillance capitalism, now I work on goods for the public” (check out her blog). She was later a researcher at Tendermint Inc for Cosmos, and then formed Cryptium Labs with Christopher and Adrian.

Adrian Brink was the third core protocol engineer to work on building the Cosmos stack at Tendermint Inc., built and scaled Cryptium Labs, and is now CEO of Heliax. Adrian’s graduate thesis topic was “censorship-resistant e-voting systems as a means of helping the Catalan people to gain their independence.”

Together they’ve attracted and built the talented Heliax team, which has grown to nearly 50 people over the past three years, raising funds from Polychain, Electric Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Maven 11, and from the Knowable team for the Anoma Foundation.

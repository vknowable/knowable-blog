## Creating A New Post

1. Create a new markdown file in the `_posts` folder. Give it a name `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md` (this naming format is required by the templating engine).
2. Add the post content.
3. Add the "front matter" (metadata) to the top of the file between the opening and closing `---`. We really only need to worry about two variables: `layout` (which will always be "post") and `title`
4. Save the file -- the changes should publish automatically within about 5 - 10 minutes!

Namada's built on Zcash research, and now Namada plans to pay incentives and tribute to the Zcash community. We're anticipating research collaboration, an airdrop, and a Zcash x Namada bridge to introduce Zcash into the Ethereum & Cosmos ecosystems. Here‚Äôs why and what to pay attention to. We‚Äôll be running a local bare metal validator (and you can too! [DM](https://twitter.com/vKnowable), [email](mailto:hi@knowable.vc)). [Stay in the Know](https://forms.gle/HRAQBSo85HGzKVSg9) for alerts._

Namada and Zcash are mission-aligned, building a future where digital payment privacy is normal. Namada has been built on modified Zcash technology, and now it‚Äôs time to collaborate with and reward the Zcash community.



* **NAM airdrop for all ZEC** holders
* **NAM grants for Zcash** research initiatives
* **Namada x Zcash bridge** will bring ZEC into Ethereum & Cosmos


### NAM airdrop for ZEC

**Namada will propose an airdrop to cover all ZEC holders, transparent and shielded.** This is a material thanks to the Zcash community for the pioneering work and culture, and for Sapling, the modified technology at the foundation of Namada‚Äôs multi-asset shielded pool. Getting NAM into the hands of ZEC holders also makes a strong, privacy focused community aware of Namada‚Äôs efforts. Details are tbd, [read the proposal here](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/rfc-proposal-for-a-strategic-alliance-between-namada-and-zcash/44372).


### NAM grants for Zcash initiatives

To further the Namada x Zcash alliance, there will be two proposals to benefit the Zcash ecosystem:



* part of the Namada‚Äôs genesis supply
* a continuous part of Namada‚Äôs inflation 

The details are to be determined, [read the proposal here](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/rfc-proposal-for-a-strategic-alliance-between-namada-and-zcash/44372). **These grants will fund RFPs, like building a Namada x Zcash bridge**.


### Namada x Zcash bridge

Research collaborations with the Zcash community will be mutually beneficial for our shared mission. Christopher Goes has proposed an initial Namada x Zcash bridge architecture and funding to implement it.

**A bridge is essential for decentralized trading of ZEC‚ÄìZcash will no longer be an island.** We should expect to see ZEC moving through a Zcash x Namada bridge to the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems and beyond. It should be a seamless and secure experience for ZEC holders, who will be able to pay Namada fees in ZEC. Namada is already shaping up to be critical infrastructure.

We anticipate bridge privacy and other future Namada x Zcash research collaborations. We expect that this will be a valuable alliance for effectively advancing our shared mission üöÄ

### General update

Knowable has been running our validator on the testnet, and we're working closely with the founding team on preparations to launch Namada's public goods funding experiment. **We think that the Namada mainnet won't launch sooner than June** (despite our previous estimate being April).

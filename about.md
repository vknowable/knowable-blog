Knowable is a Web3 community participant (not a business). If Web3 is to be essential for a better society, weâ€™ll need a compass to help maintain the course.

**Our top priority?** Develop relationships and reputation with high-integrity, values-aligned Web3 contributors and their communities.

**Our strategy?** Optimize for impact with aligned projects. Optimize for sustainable value creation over value capture.

### Mission Statement

We invest our time & attention to build relationships & reputation with Web3 communities that are creating meaningful (and ideally sustainable) value in the space.
